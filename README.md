**Unleash your custom pandemic upon the world and watch natural selection in action.**

## The World is Your Petri Dish

Have you ever wondered what it takes to create a world-ending pandemic? In **VirusForge**, you are the malevolent intelligence behind a new pathogen. Your goal is simple: evolve, adapt, and spread until humanity is no more.

You will guide your creation from a single, unnoticed infection into a global catastrophe. But be warned... the world will not stand idly by.

## Features

* 🧬 **Dynamic Evolution**: Tweak your virus's **Transmission**, **Severity**, **Incubation**, and **Evasion** to create the perfect plague.
* 🤖 **Two Modes of Play**: Take direct control with **Manual Mode** sliders or sit back and watch natural selection unfold in **Automatic Evolution**.
* 🌍 **Global Domination**: Watch your creation creep across a world map, represented by glowing infection markers that grow as your virus spreads.
* 🔬 **Contagion Visualizer**: Zoom in on the action with a real-time particle simulation showing how your virus spreads from person to person.
* 📚 **Strain Library**: Save your most successful (or disastrous) creations. Load them later for another attempt at world-ending glory!
* 📊 **In-Depth Analysis**: Track your virus's fitness, adaptation rate, R0 value, and genetic diversity with built-in analysis tools.

## The Heroes Rise: Humanity Fights Back

Your path to global annihilation will not be easy. An intelligent AI opponent represents the combined will of humanity to survive. As your virus becomes more threatening, the world will react.

These are the heroes of this story—the scientists, doctors, and world leaders who will stand against you. They will deploy a range of countermeasures to thwart your progress:

* 🚨 **Lockdowns**: As infections soar, nations will restrict movement, directly challenging your virus's transmission.
* 💉 **Vaccine Development**: If your virus is detected, humanity will race to develop a vaccine, making your **Evasion** stat critical for survival.
* 💊 **Advanced Treatments**: The development of effective treatments will reduce your virus's lethality, forcing you to adapt or be rendered harmless.
* 🌦️ **Seasonal Changes**: Random environmental shifts will test your virus's resilience and adaptability.

Can your creation out-evolve the best and brightest that humanity has to offer?
